    <h3>NOTE:</h3>
    <p> Initiate operation will start Juspay Payments SDK in the background.</p>
    <p>It is highly recommended to call initiate SDK from the order summary page (atleast 5 seconds before starting the
        payment page) for a seamless user experience.</p>
    <P>This will help Juspay in prefetching the enabled payment methods, refreshing wallet balances of the customer in
        advance.</P>
